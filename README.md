<h1 Hello! Welcome! </h1>
<p Wow! This the first time doing a HTML website! This is very fun.I really thought this would be difficult and was worried it couldn't run from an old laptop but apparently it can! Only issues are finding the right images as it can be confusing at times but I'll get the hang of it later in the semester. I chose the an image from the website as it matches the background! </p>
